# HondaCan Protocol
Description of the Honda Can Protocol, at least in the 2006 Honda Ridgeline I tested this with

#### B-Can (Body Can)
Body Can controls features like lights, locks, and windshield wipers

#### F-Can (Functional Can)
Controls powertrain related features like gauges and stability control
